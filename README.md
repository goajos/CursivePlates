Addon for combining Cursives DoT tracking and ShaguPlates nameplates.

# Dependencies
For this addon to work you need to install both addons [Cursive](https://github.com/pepopo978/Cursive) and [ShaguPlates](https://github.com/shagu/ShaguPlates) and also the client mod [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW).

# Information
## ShaguPlates
For debuffs to show up you need to tick "Enable debuffs" in the ShaguPlates settings. Only the debuffs coming in from Cursive will have timers. To not show other players debuffs tick "Only Show Own Debuffs (Experimental)" in the ShaguPlates settings.

## Cursive
You can safely disable the Cursive UI to free up UI space, this will not break CursivePlates.
